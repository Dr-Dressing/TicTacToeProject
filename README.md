# Tic-Tac-Toe Project

Copyright &copy; 2025 Dr-Dressing

This project contains a basic implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe with an AI opponent, in as many languages as I can reasonably understand.

Ideally, all "AIs" are implemented in a simple negamax algorithm. Rough eval. 

I understand that it's overkill, especially when you can hardcode "the best AI" in a game like this - but it's a proof of concept, that I am, in fact, capable of writing in a variety of languages.

If, for whatever reason, you choose to copy this project, be my guest.
